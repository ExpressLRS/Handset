With all the interesting stuff on modules, the main PCB is mostly just filtering and plugs. The V1.0 PCB pictured has several mistakes on the silk screen - those will get fixed in future revisions.

The MCU used is a TTGO GD32V Risc-V board (http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50033&Id=1251). It comes with a good quality LCD and the GD32V processor has good ADC performance for sampling the gimbals at high frequency.

TODO - more info and build instructions
