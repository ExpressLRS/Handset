The radio module is mounted on an adapter pcb to make it easy to swap different versions. Different modules can be used via different adapters, but at the moment the E28 modules are recommended. They are available in 12, 20 and 27 dBm versions and any of these can be used with the same adapter.

The adapter is very straightforward to build, it has a simple 3v3 reg and filter capacitors on the back, and just the E28 on the front.

Don't forget to reposition the 0 ohm resistor on the E28 to use the UFL!
